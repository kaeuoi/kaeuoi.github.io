      <h2>Objective for Kaeuoi</h2>
      
      <p>
        Kaeuoi can be compared to a labour union, representing the opposite than usual. Thus, instead of having the labour theory
         of capital
        as a root of its existence, Kaeuoi has Intequity (Capital of ideas) as a root, combining it with labour. The purpose is for
        Internet users, to group together against exploitation on the Internet. Lately the news showed clearly, Internet users are
        exploited, especially by social media websites. Imparting of ideas and personal information is worth a lot, making vast
        amounts of money from it. Whilst accepting advertising, e.g. Kaeuoi Community will be, ones could say, a migrant 
        community on the Internet,
        to "greener pastures", if they are not sufficiently respected by the-exploiting. The Kaeuoi Community will use their group
        power to negotiate better circumstances for the group on the Internet. An example of how group power can be used,
         is, diverting
        advertising income to Kaeuoi Community members. If website owners and managers will not be willing to share advertising
         income
        with Internet users, the Kaeuoi Community can migrate to other websites, where they are considered more.
      </p>

      <h2>Becoming a Member</h2>

      <p>Kaeuoi will be the social network of <a href="https://africahead.github.io/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html" 
        target="_blank">Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX)</a>. Groups will form on Kaeuoi representing the brand currencies listed
         on IPPAEX. For example, one of the first groups will be the
         <a href="https://fonetones.github.io/fonetones/FONtoken.html" target="_blank">fonetones (FON)</a> community.
         Ownership of the FON brand currency will make a holder of FON an automatic member of the fonetones community
         at the Kaeuoi social network, unless membership is cancelled. FON holders will have voting rights, equal to their
         percentage holding of FON. FON holders will also communicate with Africahead, which owns 52% of the fonetones brand.
         Communication between FON holders and Africahead, will increase the value of the fonetones (FON) brand currency with
          good new ideas thought of by the community. Africahead will remunerate the community with FON brand tokens, for their
          good ideas, as individuals and a group.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Initial Token Offering and Links</h3>
      
      <p>
        The plan to raise capital for Kaeuoi is: Kaeuoi (KAE) ERC20 brand tokens, on the Ethereum blockchain, are being issued to raise
        capital for development of the Kaeuoi Community.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently the logo, the name and the idea, explained above, make up the brand-value/goodwill. 
        <!--To follow the developments go
        to the 
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Tokens/Kaeuoi.html" target="_blank">Initial Token Offering (ITO) page at Africahead.</a>-->
      </p>
      
      <p>During the ITO and after the ITO, KAE brand tokens will be listed on 
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html" target="_blank">Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX)</a>.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/Moyom.html" target="_blank">Moyom (MYM)</a> utility token will be used as
        the money for the Kaeuoi Community.
      </p>
        
      <h3>Logo</h3>  
        
      
      <img src="Triangle.png" alt="Triangle
               logo" height="200" width="200">
      
      <p><a href="Triangle.png" target="_blank">Download</a> logo in .png format</p>
      
      <p><a href="Triangle.svg" target="_blank">Download</a> logo in .svg format</p>
        
        <p>Kaeuoi logo, in the above orientation, refers to one's own soul and comprehension of
        idealism as opposed to materialism. Idealism basically means, humans structure matter and their
        surrounds, starting with good ideas. Choosing idealism as dominant over materialism implies a choice is made for
        survival with creative ways. It is a choice in favour of the ideas Truth and Love, against idolatry/messianism,
         in favour of universal laws.
        It is a choice in favour of groups Being good. Choosing idealism implies considering value added by labour and
        ideas whilst remunerating accordingly, with for example, bonuses for good ideas.</p>
        
        <!--<img src="Triangle2.png" alt="Triangle
               logo" height="200" width="200">-->
        
        <!--<p><a href="Triangle2.png" target="_blank">Download</a> logo in .png format</p>
      
      <p><a href="Triangle2.svg" target="_blank">Download</a> logo in .svg format</p>-->
        
        <p>If the logo is turned around, it refers to others' souls and choosing
        materialism as opposed to idealism. Materialism basically means, humans are determined by matter and their
        surrounds. Choosing materialism as dominant over idealism, means a choice is made for survival by murderous means.
        It is a choice against the ideas Truth and Love, against universal laws. 
        It is a choice in favour of idolatry, messianism, apocalypticism and evil singularity. 
        Choosing materialism means trust in only the labour theory of capital,
        whilst imparting ideas, without remunerating people for good ideas. The Kaeuoi logo may not be used in this orientation.</p>
