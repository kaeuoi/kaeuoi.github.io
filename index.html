      <h2>Objective for Kaeuoi</h2>
      
      <p>
        Kaeuoi can be compared to a labour union, representing the opposite than usual. Thus, instead of having the labour theory of capital
        as a root of its existence, Kaeuoi has Intequity (Capital of ideas) as a root, combining it with labour. The purpose is for
        Internet users, to group together against exploitation on the Internet. Lately the news showed clearly, Internet users are
        exploited, especially by social media websites. Imparting of ideas and personal information is worth a lot, making vast
        amounts of money from it. Whilst accepting advertising, e.g. Kaeuoi Community will be, ones could say, a migrant community on the Internet,
        to "greener pastures", if they are not sufficiently respected by the-exploiting. The Kaeuoi Community will use their group
        power to negotiate better circumstances for the group on the Internet. An example of how group power can be used, is, diverting
        advertising income to Kaeuoi Community members. If website owners and managers will not be willing to share advertising income
        with Internet users, the Kaeuoi Community can migrate to other websites, where they are considered more.
      </p>

      <h2>Becoming a Member</h2>

      <p>Owning Kaeuoi (KAE) tokens will prove membership. The financial benefits when it realize, will be distributed to KAE
        token holders. Group communication will happen at the Kaeuoi group on the Cent.co social media site. Direct Message
        @mdpienaar at Cent.co to be added to the Kaeuoi group. Members are needed on all social media websites to build the Kaeuoi
        Community. The larger the Kaeuoi Community is, the more power management will have to negotiate benefits for KAE token
        holders.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Initial Token Offering and Links</h3>
      
      <p>
        The plan to raise capital for Kaeuoi is: Kaeuoi (KAE) ERC20 brand tokens, on the Ethereum blockchain, are being issued to raise
        capital for development of the Kaeuoi Community. The website will develop here on Github. Contributors will be paid
        from the capital raised by two tokens; KAE brand tokens and Moyom (MYM) utility token.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Currently the logo, the name and the idea, explained above, make up the brand-value/goodwill. To follow the developments go
        to the 
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Tokens/Kaeuoi.html" target="_blank">Initial Token Offering (ITO) page at Africahead.</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>During the ITO and after the ITO, KAE brand tokens will be listed on 
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/IppartsExchange.html" target="_blank">Ipparts Exchange (IPPAEX)</a>.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.africahead.co.za/Africahead/Moyom.html" target="_blank">Moyom (MYM)</a> utility token will be used as
        the money for the Kaeuoi Community.

        <p>Kaeuoi logo, in the above orientation, refers to one's own soul and comprehension of
        idealism as opposed to materialism. Idealism basically means, humans structure matter and their
        surrounds, starting with good ideas. Choosing idealism as dominant over materialism implies a choice is made for
        survival with creative ways. It is a choice in favour of the ideas Truth and Love and in favour of universal laws.
        It is a choice in favour of groups Being good. Choosing idealism implies considering value added by labour and
        ideas whilst remunerating accordingly, with for example, bonuses for good ideas.</p>

        <p>In the above orientation, it refers to others' souls and comprehension of
        materialism as opposed to idealism. Materialism basically means, humans are determined by matter and their
        surrounds. Choosing materialism as dominant over idealism, means a choice is made for survival by murderous means.
        It is a choice against the ideas Truth and Love and against universal laws. It is a choice in favour of idolatry,
        messianism, apocalypticism and evil singularity. Choosing materialism means trust in only the labour theory of capital,
        whilst imparting ideas, without remunerating people for good ideas.</p>
